## EuroMovie

Where European Cinema Shines

### Overview

The project is going to be about movie reviews. Most of the time people are very skeptical with the movies they want to watch because they are not sure if a movie is good enough for them to waste their time on. This web application will serve as a place to store reviews of a specific movie so that users would have a better understanding of the movie and make a better choice when choosing a movie. 


### Features

Web Application:

This is where the user will operate. First, he has to create an account for himself or log in to an existing one. He will be able to search for movies by sorting them by desired genre or by using the search bar. After the client is able to find their desired movie they will be able to press on the image of the movie and it will take them to the movie page. There the customer is able to read the reviews of a film and/or leave a review himself. If he is not pleased with what he has written he can edit or delete the review. The movie will also have a release date and it will be shown where it is available to watch.

Win Forms Application:

Only the Admin (Moderator, Manager) will have access to the application. Creating a user account is possible by the app. Moreover, the Admin will have the ability to edit the account details or delete a desired account. He can also choose on which account to do operations on. The same use cases apply for movies. Only the Admin is able to create a movie, unlike the user where the actual user has the ability to create an account in the web application. Furthermore, the admin has the ability to view statistics such as highest rated movie and users that has rated the most movies.
